# Genesis Starter Theme - Dev Kit

A development kit for WordPress themes which includes starter SCSS files and a Gulp task file which automates:

1. JS compression
2. SCSS compiling and compression
3. File watching
4. Generation of a POT file for translation
5. Automatic zipping of the theme without including the development files.

This dev kit was originally built for my own Starter theme on the Genesis Framework, but it can be used for any WordPress theme with minimal modification (mostly file structuring and naming differences).

### Reasons to Use Starter

- It comes accessible out of the gate.
- It's mobile-first (read why <a href="https://calvinkoepke.com/mobile-first">this is a good thing</a>).
- It comes pre-packaged with default settings and templates that are common in Genesis child theme development.
- It removes the unnecessary (and discouraged) blog template from the parent Genesis theme.
- It has almost **zero** styling, reducing visual influence on your projects.
- It comes with a ready-to-use, modified version of <a href="http://robincornett.com/genesis-responsive-menu/">Robin Cornett's responsive menu</a>.
- It comes with a Landing Page template. Ideas for more to be added in future releases.

## What the Gulp Automation Does
- The Gulp task file will watch dev files under `/assets/` in the SCSS/JS directories and rebuild files on the fly.
- **Note:** To separate dev from prod files, the tasker will output minified files to a `/build/` folder at the theme root.
- File naming will stay the same with `.min.ext` appended to the file name.

## Installation
**NOTE:** Use of the Gulp task file requires you to have <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node">Node and NPM</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/install">SASS</a> installed on your computer.

1. Clone the repo to your desktop, somewhere **other** than in your theme root (you don't want updates to override your theme edits!)
2. Copy the files in the cloned repo to your theme root.
3. Move `/scss/` to the `/assets/` directory.
4. In terminal, navigate to the theme root directory:

```
$ cd /theme/directory/root 
```

5. Run the following NPM command to install task dependencies. This will also automatically initiate first compiling, JS compression and `/build/` folder creation, and file watching.

```
$ npm install --save-dev --legacy-bundling
```

6. You're good to go!

## Optional Commands
There are two optional Gulp commands for you to use in the Terminal:

### Build POT File for Translation
To build a POT file for your theme (so translators can include different languages), you need to generate a POT file. This is usually pretty tedious, but Gulp makes it easy and as simple as running this command:

```
$ gulp translate-theme
```

That's it! Gulp will translate all the PHP files in your theme, and output a POT file in a newly created `/translation/` directory in your theme root. **NOTE:** You'll have to include the translation file in your theme's `functions.php` file for use.

### Package Theme for Production
You can package your theme for production in a ZIP file by running the following command. Depending on the size of your theme, it may take a while â€” be patient! The command will automatically ignore dev-kit files (gulpfile.js, package.json, and node_modules). It will keep the SCSS folder in `/assets/` since end-users will find this useful.

**NOTE**: It might be a good idea to update the compression method for SCSS to `compressed` just prior to packaging, and manually add the commented header at the top after output (this creates smaller file, but will remove the `style.css` header and thus break the theme).

```
$ gulp package-theme
```
